# The-Robot-Shop


This is a program to help out the startup Robbie Robot Shop.

In the Main Menu the user is asked to choose from 9 options.
9 options include (1)making robot components. Then (2)viewing the created components.
Then from the created components, new robot models can be defined(3). The user can choose whatever
type of combinations for the robot (given that they do not go over 2 arms, and 1 for each of the
remaining parts). Following that the user can view the robot(4). Either detailed view
or regular view. Atleast one robot must be created to use function 4.

Following the creation of robot models, the user can now create an order(5).
After the prompt that is created from function number 5 is filled out,
the user can either view bill of sale by customer(6), or
view list of order by a particular sales associate(7), or
view all the list of orders by all sales associate(8), and finally
view sales report on a particular sales associate(9) - where
the sales associate's number of sales (number of orders they completed),
number of robots sold, and total revenue from those robots sold are displayed.
